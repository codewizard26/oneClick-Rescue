OneClick Rescue ‚Äì Emergency Cross-Chain Wallet Recovery Powered by SideShift.ai

üîç Problem

Crypto users often manage funds across multiple wallets and blockchains. In the unfortunate event of a wallet compromise or hack, users need to urgently move their assets to a safe wallet. But manually swapping and bridging assets across chains is:

Time-consuming ‚Äì multiple steps and interfaces

Expensive ‚Äì fees add up across chains

Complex ‚Äì hard to optimize routes and know what to do quickly

Risky ‚Äì delay in action can lead to total loss

There is no tool today that helps a user instantly consolidate and recover funds from a compromised wallet across chains into a single safe wallet with one click.

üí° Solution: OneClick Rescue

OneClick Rescue is a cross-chain rescue system that enables users to:

Detect and prioritize assets across chains from a compromised wallet

Instantly plan a recovery route using optimized swaps and bridges

Use SideShift.ai to perform seamless cross-chain shifts of tokens

Transfer all valuable assets into a new safe wallet on a single chain

Do all of this in one click, with full transparency and control

The goal is to minimize time exposed to attackers and maximize recovered value ‚Äî using SideShift.ai as the core infrastructure.

üß† How it works (Flow)

User Connects Compromised Wallet
User visits the app, connects the compromised wallet (read-only), and enters the new safe wallet address.

Asset Discovery & Risk Prioritization
The app scans all supported chains to discover tokens held in the compromised wallet and estimates their USD value and urgency (based on risk/volume).

Recovery Plan Generation
An optimized plan is built that:

Swaps tokens (if needed) to SideShift-compatible tokens

Routes funds via SideShift.ai to the chosen chain & destination wallet

Minimizes fees and slippage

One-Click Rescue Execution
The user reviews the plan and approves. The app executes the swaps and cross-chain shifts via SideShift.ai. Transactions are signed client-side.

Progress Dashboard + Final Report
The user sees real-time progress, tx links, and final confirmations. A full audit report is generated for transparency.
